Importantly, we can gain more insight into these now, and we have worked logically through to filter unnecessary information for our story - we now want to learn more about the malware IPs since there are a great number of these. Also worth noting, we are now working with 5.9% of our original data (15171 rows) making it much more manageable to explore and find relavent details, rather than being inudated with irrelavent information. Our SOC team were struggling with the number of alerts they were dealing with - this workflow would allow them to manage the alerts much more effectively, and concentrate on the key details of interest.\n",

        "Having developed this in a Notebook for the purpose of exploration, we could easier export this as a Python script that would run periodically to filter our alerts as needed.\n",

        "This example should help to demonstrate the benefit of interactive analysis of the data, and how this can be used to rapidly design a suitable analysis workflow for deployment."
